I'm Aryan Dubey, a Graduate Student at Carnegie Mellon University and currently a 3x Kaggle Grandmaster (Notebooks, Datasets & Discussion).

Having started coding at an early age and also having completed my Bachelor’s, I can say my interest in this field has only grown with time. I gravitate more towards Data Science,Data Analysis and AI. Working in the technology sector in  National Payement corporation of India, have worked in various Department like Information Security and UPI global tech has helped me gain relevant experience in the industry. As businesses today are becoming more inextricably linked with information technology, I strive to utilize my expertise to bridge the gap between technology and business.       

My key interest lies solely in sharing my technical expertise with people. I thoroughly enjoy tackling problems pertaining to technology and coming up with novel ideas.
